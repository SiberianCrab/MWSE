		If assigning a string, the available values are present in [`tes3.inventorySelectFilter`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/inventory-select-filters/) namespace. The available filters are:

		- `alembic`: Only [tes3apparatus](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3apparatus/) items of type `tes3.apparatusType.alembic` will be shown.
		- `calcinator`: Only [tes3apparatus](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3apparatus/) items of type `tes3.apparatusType.calcinator` will be shown.
		- `enchanted`: Only non-enchanted items will be shown. That's because that filter is usually used in the enchanting menu to select items viable for enchanting.
		- `ingredients`: Only [tes3ingredient](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3ingredient/) items will be shown.
		- `mortar`: Only [tes3apparatus](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3apparatus/) items of type `tes3.apparatusType.mortarAndPestle` will be shown.
		- `quickUse`: Only items that can be assigned as quick keys will be shown.
		- `retort`: Only [tes3apparatus](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3apparatus/) items of type `tes3.apparatusType.retort` will be shown.
		- `soulgemFilled`: Only filled soulgems will be shown.

		If assigning a custom function it will be called when determining if an item should be added to the inventory select menu. Returning `true` from this function will add the item to the inventory select menu, whereas returning `false` will prevent it from being added.]],
