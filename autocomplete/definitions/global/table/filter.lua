Any additional arguments will be passed to `f`. For example, `table.filter(t, f, 10)` would call `f(k, v, 10)` on each pair `k, v` of `t`.

!!! warning
 	Do not use this function on array-style tables, as it will not shift indices down after filtering out elements. Instead, you should use `table.filterarray` on array-style tables.
