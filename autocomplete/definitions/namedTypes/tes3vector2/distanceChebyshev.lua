	description = [[Calculates the distance to another vector, using the [Chebyshev metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance), which is defined as

	math.max(math.abs(v1.x - v2.x), math.abs(v1.y - v2.y))

This is useful for ensuring that the x and y coordinates between two vectors are all (independently) within a certain distance from each other.

Here is a geometric description of the difference between the normal distance and the Chebyshev distance for two `tes3vector2`s  `v1` and `v2`:

* If `v1:distance(v2) <= 1`, then `v2` is contained in a circle around `v1` with radius 1 (i.e. diameter 2).
* If `v1:distanceChebyshev(v2) <= 1`, then `v2` is contained within a square centered around `v1`, where the square sides have length 2.
