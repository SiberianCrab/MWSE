A temporary data structure used in the processing of crimes the player has committed.

## Properties

### `bountyKey`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">bountykey</div>

Contains the stringified version of the type used for bounty-related functions.

**Returns**:

* `result` (string)

***

### `criminal`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">criminal</div>

The player mobile will be used as a default value, meaning that there is no direct victim. Other values may be possible but will generally not be reacted to by AI and discarded.

For crimes of type `tes3.crimeType.witnessReaction` the criminal will always be the witness, unless it is reacting to a crime of type `tes3.crimeType.killing`, in which case the criminal mobile will be used.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md))

***

### `position`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">position</div>

The position of the crime. This will be the position of the victim of an attack/killing or the position of the criminal otherwise.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3vector3](../types/tes3vector3.md))

***

### `stolenFrom`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">stolenfrom</div>

Who was stolen from with this crime. Valid for crimes of type `tes3.crimeType.theft` or `tes3.crimeType.pickpocket`.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3object](../types/tes3object.md))

***

### `stolenValue`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">stolenvalue</div>

The value associated with the crime. Valid for crimes of type `tes3.crimeType.theft` or `tes3.crimeType.pickpocket`

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `timestamp`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">timestamp</div>

The time at which the crime has been committed. This is not the time at which the crime has been witnessed.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `type`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">type</div>

The base crime type. Maps to `tes3.crimeType`.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3.crimeType](../references/crime-types.md))

***

### `victim`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">victim</div>

The player mobile will be used as a default value, meaning that there is no victim.

If the default value is set, the proper victim can be retrieved from the stolenFrom field for crimes of type `tes3.crimeType.theft` or `tes3.crimeType.pickpocket`.

For crimes of type `tes3.crimeType.witnessReaction` the victim will always be the player mobile.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md))

***

### `victimFaction`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">victimfaction</div>

The faction of the crime victim. This field will always be filled with the correct information, even if player has been set as a default value for the victim.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3faction](../types/tes3faction.md))

***

### `witnesses`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">witnesses</div>

A list of AIPlanners that were able to detect the criminal.
