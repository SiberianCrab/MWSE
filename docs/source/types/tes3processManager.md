## Properties

### `aiDistance`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">aidistance</div>

A value which controls how far the game AI is processed, measured in game distance units. Corresponds to AI Distance slider in Options menu.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `aiDistanceScale`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">aidistancescale</div>

A value which controls how far the game AI is processed. Corresponds to AI Distance slider in Options menu. This scale is in range [0, 1]. Where `0` means the minimal AI processing range, while `1` means maximal AI processing range.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `allMobileActors`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">allmobileactors</div>

*Read-only*. A copy of the list of mobiles with currently running AI. This does not include the player. The available objects are only valid at a point in time, and maybe be deleted or re-used any time a mobile is moved or disabled, so this data should only be used in the same moment that it is read. This is not a lightweight accessor, so it should be used carefully.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../types/tes3mobileActor.md)[])

***

### `allPlanners`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">allplanners</div>

*Read-only*. A copy of the list of currently running AI planners. This does not include the player. The available objects are only valid at a point in time, and maybe be deleted or re-used any time a mobile is moved or disabled, so this data should only be used in the same moment that it is read. This is not a lightweight accessor, so it should be used carefully.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3aiPlanner](../types/tes3aiPlanner.md)[])

***
