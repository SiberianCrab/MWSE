Provides support for interacting with yaml data, through the yaml-cpp library. The interface is a direct copy of the one found in OpenMW, to ensure compatibility. YAML is not recommended for any use outside of OpenMW compatibility.

## Functions

### `yaml.decode`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">decode</div>

Decode string representing yaml into a table.

```lua
local result = yaml.decode(input)
```

**Parameters**:

* `input` (string): The string to be decoded into a table.

**Returns**:

* `result` (table): The decoded table.

***

### `yaml.loadFile`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">loadfile</div>

Loads a yaml file from `path`, using `yaml.decode`. Unlike the related `json.loadfile` function, this is relative to the current working directory, and not relative to Data Files\MWSE. A file extension should be part of the `path` string.

```lua
local data, error = yaml.loadFile(path)
```

**Parameters**:

* `path` (string): The file to read from, relative to the current working directory (typically the Morrowind installation folder).

**Returns**:

* `data` (table?): The decoded data, or `nil` if the file could not be found.
* `error` (table?): Information about why the yaml file could not be decoded. This result will only be given if the operation fails.
