This event is called when a new object is created.

```lua
--- @param e objectCreatedEventData
local function objectCreatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.objectCreated, objectCreatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`object`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `copiedFrom` ([tes3object](../types/tes3object.md)): *Read-only*. If the object was created by first copying another object, that object is available here.
* `object` ([tes3baseObject](../types/tes3baseObject.md)): *Read-only*. The object that was created.
