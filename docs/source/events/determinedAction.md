This event fires when an actor has determined an action in a combat session. The action chosen is `session.selectedAction`, which can be changed to affect the actor AI. Note that other data in `e.session` like `selectedWeapon` or `selectedMagic` is only indicative of the AI's choice. The weapon or magic that the actor uses must be set on the mobile.

```lua
--- @param e determinedActionEventData
local function determinedActionCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.determinedAction, determinedActionCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data
