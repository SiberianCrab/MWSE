Fires when the game deletes and recreates the topics list available to the player.

```lua
--- @param e topicsListUpdatedEventData
local function topicsListUpdatedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.topicsListUpdated, topicsListUpdatedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
