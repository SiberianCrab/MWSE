This event is triggered when a global script is started. This includes usage of the `StartScript` command, any scripts that are assigned as a "Start Script" in the editor, and any previously-running global scripts in the save file which get restarted after loading.

The primary use case of this event is to expose lua functionality to dialogue or morrowind script contexts.
	

```lua
--- @param e startGlobalScriptEventData
local function startGlobalScriptCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.startGlobalScript, startGlobalScriptCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`script.id`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md), nil): *Read-only*. The reference that the script is targeted at, if any.
* `script` ([tes3script](../types/tes3script.md)): *Read-only*. The script that is being started.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Calculating cosine from mwscript"

	```lua
	-- This example shows how to perform a cosine calculation inside mwscript. It
	-- demonstrates how to execute lua functions from mwscript, and how to pass
	-- variables between the languages.
	
	-- TESCS script definition:
	-- The script body is intentionally empty, the logic will be implemented in lua.
	-- For typical usage we only need to define the variables that we will use.
	--
	--[[
		begin CalculateCosine
		float input
		float result
		StopScript CalculateCosine ; Not required, but good practice.
		end
	]]
	
	-- Using our function:
	-- This is what using our script would look like. Typically from another script,
	-- or from a dialogue result. This example assumes a `var` variable was defined.
	--
	--[[
		set CalculateCosine.input to 15
		StartScript CalculateCosine
		set var to CalculateCosine.result
	]]
	
	-- The actual lua implementation:
	
	---@param e startGlobalScriptEventData
	local function onStartGlobalScript(e)
		if e.script.id == "CalculateCosine" then
			local context = e.script.context
			context.result = math.deg(math.cos(math.rad(context.input)))
			-- Note: We return false here so the actual script never executes.
			-- This is usually what you want! Otherwise the script would begin
			-- running and subsequent `StartScript` calls would not trigger our
			-- event.
			return false
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.startGlobalScript, onStartGlobalScript)
