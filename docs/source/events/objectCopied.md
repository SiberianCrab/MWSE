This event is called when one object's data is copied to another object.

```lua
--- @param e objectCopiedEventData
local function objectCopiedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.objectCopied, objectCopiedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`original`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `copy` ([tes3object](../types/tes3object.md)): *Read-only*. The object being copied to.
* `original` ([tes3object](../types/tes3object.md)): *Read-only*. The object being copied from.
