This event is called prior to adding body parts to for a piece of equipment (armor or clothing).

```lua
--- @param e updateBodyPartsForItemEventData
local function updateBodyPartsForItemCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.updateBodyPartsForItem, updateBodyPartsForItemCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`item`** event data.

!!! tip
	This event supports blocking by setting `e.block` to `true` or returning `false`. Blocking the event prevents vanilla behavior from happening. For example, blocking an `equip` event prevents the item from being equipped.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `bodyPartManager` ([tes3bodyPartManager](../types/tes3bodyPartManager.md)): *Read-only*. `reference`'s body part manager.
* `isFemale` (boolean): *Read-only*. If true, the reference is female.
* `isFirstPerson` (boolean): *Read-only*. If true, the reference is first person.
* `item` ([tes3item](../types/tes3item.md)): The item whose parts will be used. This can be changed to provide an override. Note that items must be of the same type (i.e. armor to armor, but not armor to clothing).
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../types/tes3reference.md)): *Read-only*. Whose body parts are being built for the given item.
