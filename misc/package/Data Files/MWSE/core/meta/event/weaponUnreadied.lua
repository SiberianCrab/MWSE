--- This event is called when a weapon is no longer readied, and pairs with the weaponReadied event. It can be used to reliably tell if a specific weapon is readied for attack. This does not necessarily mean that the animation state has changed for the first time. If an actor equips a weapon while having their hands up to attack with, the event will fire for the new weapon.
