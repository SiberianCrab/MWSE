--- The **weatherTransitionStarted** event occurs when the currently simulated weather has started to gradually transition to a new weather. This can occur when moving between regions, or when the weather cycles.
--- 
--- Weather will not start transitioning in interiors, but will continue transitioning, and may finish while in an interior. The transition may be interrupted at any time by the [weatherChangedImmediate](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/weatherChangedImmediate) event, and the [weatherTransitionFinished](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/weatherTransitionFinished) event will not occur.
