--- @meta
--- This event is triggered after magic absorption absorbs and cancels a magic effect, and just before magic absorption gives magicka to the target. It can control the amount of magicka restored.
--- 
--- This event occurs once per effect restored, so a multi-effect spell may trigger this multiple times. The default amount restored is equal to the casting cost of the entire spell, which is the vanilla behaviour.
--- @class absorbedMagicEventData
