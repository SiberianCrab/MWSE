--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/jump).
--- @class jumpEventData
--- @field block boolean If set to `true`, vanilla logic will be suppressed. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field claim boolean If set to `true`, any lower-priority event callbacks will be skipped. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field applyFatigueCost boolean If `false`, this jump will not reduce fatigue.
--- @field isDefaultJump boolean *Read-only*. If `true`, the jump has been initiated from the ground and without custom velocity or fatigue cost. This does not change if other event callbacks change any of these parameters.
--- @field mobile tes3mobileActor|tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|tes3mobilePlayer *Read-only*. The mobile actor that is trying to jump.
--- @field reference tes3reference *Read-only*. Mobile's related reference.
