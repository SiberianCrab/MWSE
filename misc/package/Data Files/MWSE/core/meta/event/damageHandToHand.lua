--- The damageHandToHand event triggers before an actor takes fatigue damage from hand-to-hand combat. It does not trigger on health damage, but the `damage` event will. The `fatigueDamage` value can be modified, or can be prevented completely by blocking the event. The player as attacker will gain hand-to-hand experience only if `fatigueDamage` is greater than zero.
