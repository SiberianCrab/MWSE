--- This event is invoked whenever an actor makes an attack with their fists or a weapon, or a creature makes any attack. It occurs at the moment a melee attack would hit, at the end of a melee weapon strike. For projectile attacks, it is when an arrow is about to detach from its bow. A target is not required to be present for this event.
