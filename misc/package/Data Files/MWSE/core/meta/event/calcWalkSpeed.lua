--- One of the movement events, **calcWalkSpeed** is used when calculating the base walk speed. Nearly every other movement speed event starts with this, with the exception of [calcFlySpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcFlySpeed).
--- 
--- The movement event flow is described below:
--- 
--- - Walking: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
--- - Running: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcRunSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
--- - Swimming: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
--- - Swimming (while running): **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> [calcSwimRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimRunSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
--- @class calcWalkSpeedEventData
--- @field claim boolean If set to `true`, any lower-priority event callbacks will be skipped. Returning `false` will set this to `true`.
--- @field mobile tes3mobileActor|tes3mobileCreature|tes3mobileNPC|tes3mobilePlayer *Read-only*. The mobile actor whose speed is being calculated.
--- @field reference tes3reference *Read-only*. mobileâ€™s related reference.
--- @field speed number The previous speed calculated, starting with the base engine values.
--- @field type number *Read-only*. The type of movement that was calculated. This is always 1 for this event.
