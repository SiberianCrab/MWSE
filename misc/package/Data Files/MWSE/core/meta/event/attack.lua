--- @meta
--- This event is invoked whenever an actor commits to an attack with their fists or a weapon, or a creature makes any attack. It occurs at the release time of the attack, such as the downstroke of a melee weapon or when an arrow is shot. For the player, it is when the attack button is released. A target is not required to be present for this event. For the actual moment the attack hits, use the `attackHit` event.
--- 
--- This event has specific combat mechanics occuring at this point. This is the time when the target has a chance to use its block skill, when on-strike enchantments may be applied, and when elemental shields do reflected damage. There is still a small period of time while the attack animation completes before the hit, so it is still possible for a target to move out of range (normally only seen with short weapons).
--- 
--- Lockpicks and probes do not invoke this event.
