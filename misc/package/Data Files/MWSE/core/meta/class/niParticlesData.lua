--- @meta
--- niParticlesData objects contain the geometry data necessary to render a niParticles object. When a niParticles-based object is created, the actual geometry data is stored in an attached niParticlesData object.
--- 
--- There are two ways to adjust particle size within an niParticles object. The `radius` affects all the particles in this niParticlesData object. There is also a `size` for each particle (available as `sizes` array), which is a ratio between 0.0 and 1.0 that is multiplied by the radius to obtain the final rendered size of the particle.
--- @class niParticlesData : niTriBasedGeometryData, niGeometryData, niObject
--- @field activeCount number The number of active particles. Must be no larger than `vertexCount`.
--- @field radius number The radius (particle size) of the particles.
--- @field sizes number[] *Read-only*. An array controlling individual particle sizes. Values should be in the range 0 to 1. The length of the array is equal to `vertexCount`.
