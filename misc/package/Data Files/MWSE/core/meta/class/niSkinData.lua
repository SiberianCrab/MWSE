--- @meta
--- Contains skinning data that may be shared by multiple `NiSkinInstance` objects.
--- @class niSkinData : niObject
--- @field boneData niSkinDataBoneData[] *Read-only*. An array of objects containing one entry for each bone that influences vertices in the skinned mesh. The order of the entries in the `boneData` array corresponds to the order of the bones in the bone array in the `niSkinInstance` objects that point to this `niSkinData`. Each object in this array contains all the data needed to deform vertices by a single bone.
--- @field partition niSkinPartition|nil Access to the container with the skinning data optimized for hardware skinning. If the `niSkinData` object has not been partitioned, this property is `nil`.
--- @field transform tes3transform Defines the transform of the root bone in the bind pose from the parent node of the root bone to the coordinate system of the skinned object.
