--- @field gridY number *Read-only*. The cell's Y grid coordinate.
--- @field maxHeight number *Read-only*. The height of the highest land vertex.
--- @field minHeight number *Read-only*. The height of the lowest land vertex.
--- @field sceneNode niBSAnimationNode|niBSParticleNode|niBillboardNode|niCollisionSwitch|niNode|niSortAdjustNode|niSwitchNode *Read-only*. The scene graph node for the landscape. Contains sub nodes for land patches.
--- @field textureIndices number[] *Read-only*. An array containing texture index numbers. They are 0-based indexes. They index into the global land texture list, `tes3.dataHandler.nonDynamicData.landTextures`. Adjustment is required when indexing the list through lua.
