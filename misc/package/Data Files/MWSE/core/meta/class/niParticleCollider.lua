--- This modifier provides framework for collision testing. The classes derived from this one: niSphericalCollider, and niPlanarCollider, test for collisions. Each frame a niParticleSystemController traverses its list of niParticlesColliders to determine if any collisions happened.
--- @class niParticleCollider : niParticleModifier, niObject
--- @field collisionPoint tes3vector3 
--- @field collisionTime number 
--- @field dieOnCollide boolean If this flag is true a particle that collides with something will be destroyed.
--- @field restitution number The fraction of the original amount of energy the particle retains after a collision.
--- @field spawnOnCollide boolean This flag controls if a new particle will be spawned on a collision. The new particle is spawned at the position of the old particle with the same attributes.
