--- An instance of `niSkinDataBoneDataVertexWeight` exists for every vertex that is influenced by a particular bone. This container stores the weight coefficients used for each vertex when deforming skinned objects with this bone.
--- @class niSkinDataBoneDataVertexWeight
--- @field index integer The index of the vertex in the skinned object's array of vertices.
--- @field weight number The weight of the bone's influence on the vertex. The sum of the weights for all the bones that influence a particular vertex must be 1.0.
