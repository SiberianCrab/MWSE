--- A table used to configure the behavior of functions in the [json API](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/json/).
--- @class jsonConfig
--- @field buffer string[]|nil Used to store the strings for the result so they can be concatenated at once. When it isn't given, the encode function will create it temporarily and will return the concatenated result.

--- 	This field is used internally by the implementation and is usually not of interest to the end user.
--- @field bufferlen integer|nil When bufferlen is set, it has to be the index of the last element of buffer.

--- @field exception (fun(reason: "reference cycle"|"custom encoder failed"|"unsupported type", value, state: jsonConfig, defaultMessage: string): string|true|nil, string?)? When exception is raised, this callback function will be called whenever the encoder cannot encode a given value. The parameters are `reason`, `value`, `state` and `defaultmessage`. `reason` is either `"reference cycle"`, `"custom encoder failed"` or `"unsupported type"`. `value` is the original value that caused the exception, `state` is this `jsonConfig` table, `defaultmessage` is the message of the error that would usually be raised. The callback can either return `true` and write encoded `value` directly to the `buffer` or you can return the encoded string. If the callback decides to raise an error, return `nil` and the desired error message. An example implementation for an exception function is given in `json.encodeexception`.
--- @field indent boolean|nil When indent is set, the created string will contain newlines and indentations. Otherwise it will be one long line.
--- @field keyorder string[]|nil Used to specify the ordering of keys in the encoded output. If an object has keys which are not in this array they are written after the sorted keys.
--- @field level integer|nil This is the initial level of indentation used when indent is set. For each level two spaces are added. When absent it is set to 0.

--- @field tables table<table, true>|nil This field is used to detect cyclic references. It is created temporarily when absent. Every table that is currently processed is used as key, the value is true.
