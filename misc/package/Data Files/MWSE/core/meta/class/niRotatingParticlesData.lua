--- niRotatingParticlesData objects contain the geometry data necessary to render a niRotatingParticles object. When a niRotatingParticles-based object is created, the actual geometry data is stored in an attached niRotatingParticlesData object.
--- @class niRotatingParticlesData : niParticlesData, niTriBasedGeometryData, niGeometryData, niObject
--- @field rotations niQuaternion[] *Read-only*. The particle rotations. The length of the array is equal to `vertexCount`.
